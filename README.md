Our Service: an application called "J에게" that helps middle-aged and older adults form communities to reduce loneliness and increase self-efficacy by learning what they want.

Problems we found

- Provide a platform to find hobbies or receive education without being constrained by time or location, and to communicate with like-minded people
- Help middle-aged and elderly individuals, who live apart from their children, engage in activities that enhance mental health and emotional happiness rather than passive activities like watching TV or YouTube, thus contributing to a meaningful second life exclusively for them

Expected Benefits
- Realization of a second life for middle-aged and elderly individuals and retirees
- Besides achieving SDGs 4 and 10, lay the foundation for achieving “Good Health and Well-being” (3), “Decent Work and Economic Growth” (8), “Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure” (9), and “Sustainable Cities and Communities” (11)
